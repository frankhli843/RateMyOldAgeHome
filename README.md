# RateMyOldAgeHome
- Our elderly are some of the most vunerable people within our society and with a large retiring demographic in Canada and US we need to find ways to make sure they are being treated properly.
- The vision of this project is help protect the elderly who are in senoir homes while recognizing and rewarding caretakers who go out of the way to provide compassionate care. We also want to work together with other organizations to find better ways of taking care our eldery through home visits. 
- This is the open sourced repo for www.ratemyoldagehome.com which will be maintained and owned by the non profit.
