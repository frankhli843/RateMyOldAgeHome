# RateMyOldAgeHome
- The problem:
  - Our elderly are some of the most vunerable people within our society and with a large retiring demographic in Canada and US we need to find ways to make sure they are being treated properly. 
  - Care takers are also not recongized and properly compenstated for the good work they do. They are underpaid and underappreciated.
- The vision: 
  - help protect the elderly who are in senoir homes while recognizing 
  - rewarding caretakers and recongizing who go out of the way to provide compassionate care. 
- The mission:
  - build a web platform that allows users to rate old age homes as well as caretakers through www.ratemyoldagehome.com
- The work done here will be maintained and owned by the non profit.
